Setup the project locally and start a server and a frontEnd to run the project.

### Prerequisites
- Git
- Docker (optional, for container-based setups)
- Node.js and npm (for JavaScript frameworks)
- .NET SDK
- Java JDK
- PHP
- Composer (for PHP Laravel)

### Common Setup Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/days-until.git
   cd daysuntil

### Current development state
As this is a private project, I try to update it regularly. 
It can happen that some methods are not yet fully developed before I have turned my attention to other aspects. 
However, these will be gradually updated in order to have a solid project in every language and framework used.
